# Hi, I'm David Anderson 👋

I build AI-powered tools that solve real problems for people who aren't developers.

Most of my work is production software—full-stack applications with AI integration, workflow automation, and systems that non-technical users can actually use. I focus on taking complex AI capabilities and making them accessible through intuitive interfaces.

I run **fullstackvibes.io**, where I showcase my work building enterprise AI applications from scratch.

## What I Build

- 🤖 **AI-Powered Applications**: Multi-agent systems with Claude AI and Azure OpenAI for document analysis, workflow automation, and decision support
- 🔄 **Workflow Automation**: End-to-end automation pipelines that eliminate manual processes
- 📊 **Data-Driven Tools**: Real-time dashboards, analytics systems, and reporting tools
- 🏗️ **Full-Stack Systems**: Complete applications from database design to deployment
- 🧪 **RAG Pipelines**: Custom retrieval-augmented generation systems for enterprise knowledge management
- 🎯 **AI Agents**: Task-specific agents for document processing, compliance checking, and automated reporting

## Real-World Impact

**VUES Suite** — 6 production AI applications serving 800+ users daily:

- **LegislationVUE**: Python/FastAPI + Azure OpenAI processing **20,000+ legislative documents**, eliminated **$40K+/year** in legal consulting
- **InitiativeVUE**: Go/HTMX platform with Claude AI for automated status reporting, serving **50+ concurrent users**
- **PlanVUE**: AI-powered project management achieving **80% efficiency gain** (5 days → 1 day)
- **FacilityVUE**: Multi-tenant SaaS platform supporting **100+ organizations** with AI-driven insights
- **SharePointVUE**: Playwright automation scanning **500+ pages/run** with Claude AI for accessibility analysis

**Tenant Wise**: Next.js SaaS with Claude AI generating Texas Property Code-compliant legal documents, Stripe subscriptions, automated workflows

## Tech Stack

## About Me

- 🏢 Digital Experience Architect at MOREgroup — Built and deployed 6 AI applications with **130+ API endpoints**, **55+ database tables**
- 🎓 10+ years progressive experience from resource management → media lab → product development
- 🌱 Passionate about AI accessibility — making powerful AI capabilities usable for non-technical teams
- 💡 I believe the best AI tools are the ones people don't need a manual to use
- 📍 Paradise, Texas

## What Drives Me

I'm interested in the intersection of AI capability and user experience. The most powerful AI in the world is useless if people can't figure out how to use it. I focus on building systems that solve actual problems, not technical demos.

If you're building AI tools that people will actually use in production, I'd love to chat.
